<big>Safety</big><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"> &nbsp; I am visible yellow.
&nbsp;Visibility is my main safety concern when riding any cycle on the
street, especially at night. &nbsp;So, I have good lights. &nbsp;The low
height of the tricycle does not seem to prevent drivers from seeing
me.&nbsp; Some wisdom from Dana Lieberman, on the bentrideronline trike
forum:&nbsp; "drivers have a hard time seeing you from the side, not the
front and back. Thus, you have to be aware of situations where you
become invisible, and ride appropriately".&nbsp; The only time that I
really get concerned about the low profile is when I'm riding through a
parking lot, and someone might back up without seeing me. &nbsp;There is
a flag.&nbsp; I just use the factory flag; I don't feel the need to add
any additional flaggage, though I do admire those who <a

</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> &nbsp; My lights are bright. &nbsp;I
actually feel more visible at night than in the day. &nbsp;I have a
NiteRider headlight (32 watts of halogen) and high-intensity LED
taillight, which both run off of the water-bottle style battery mounted
under the seat. &nbsp;I originally installed the taillight directly
under the top of the back of the rack - but then I realized that the
light was not visible from the sides, since it was between the panniers.
&nbsp;The taillight is now installed on the top side of the rack.
&nbsp;(The NiteRider taillight is designed to provide some visibility
from the sides.) &nbsp;For backup, and just extra lighting for
high-traffic experiences, I have two Cateye EL-400 LED headlights and a
Cateye LED taillight. &nbsp;I use flashing mode for all of the LED
lights (to be seen better).<br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> &nbsp; I recommend clipless pedals when
riding a trike. &nbsp;Having a foot slip off of the pedal could result
in a foot hitting the ground, which could be extremely unpleasant at
high speed. &nbsp;Having a clipless pedal system does not eliminate the
possibility of a foot slip, but it reduces it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried Shimano SPD pedals, but felt like my feet did not
have enough freedom of movement, and my knees were at risk. &nbsp;The
Crank Brothers' egg-beater style pedals are much more comfortable.
&nbsp;They seem to allow more 'degrees of freedom'. &nbsp;The SPD's
seemed to rotate ('float') about a single fixed point only, whereas the
egg-beaters seem to rotate about any point that I want them to.<br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> &nbsp; The dual mirrors are helpful.
&nbsp;It is difficult for me to turn my head to see behind me, without
accidentally adding some unwanted input to the steering. &nbsp;I use the
miror on the left mostly, but depending on the situation, sometimes I
can get a better view out of the right-hand mirror. &nbsp;And, the dual
mirror setup provides a couple of extra hand positions, resting the hand
fully or partially on the mirror booms.<br>

<big>Health</big><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"> &nbsp; The exercise that I get on the
Pocket is highly aerobic. &nbsp;With the low gear range of the Pocket
(thanks to small wheels coupled with standard drivetrain components), I
don't need to 'mash' up the big hills, I can 'spin'. </div>
