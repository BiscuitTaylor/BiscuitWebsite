<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; I commute 9 miles to work.&nbsp;
I do it on the trike at least twice a week.&nbsp; Other times I
drive.&nbsp; I like the feeling of being oil-independent, though, when
I'm on the trike.&nbsp; My commute is rather hilly.&nbsp; My biggest
climb, <a href="TheHill.jpg">Coyote Street</a>, is a 300 foot vertical
gain.<br>

picture was taken the day I forgot
my flag, of course.&nbsp; Catrike lists the pocket at 27 pounds,
without pedals.&nbsp;
Accessorized with fenders, the Old Man Mountain rack, Radical panniers,
NiteRider lights (minus the battery), Candy C pedals, 2 mirrors, 2
bottle cages, and an inflatable lumbar pillow, the trike weighs in at
36
pounds (unloaded, no fairing).<br>

55 lb, loaded<br>
Loaded for the normal winter commute - add NiteRider battery, water,
tools, work clothes, and fairing.<br>
A 27.5 lb trike? with 27.5 lb of stuff on it?!!!<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; The fairing is supposed to keep
me warmer and drier than I would be without it.&nbsp; I think it does a
good job. &nbsp;I've ridden in the cold and rain, and my feet have
never been cold (or wet), that's for sure.<br>

&nbsp; The commute is mostly a very mellow part of my day. &nbsp;The
long, slow sections are very relaxing, mentally. &nbsp;The brain is not
occupied with staying balanced, and is free to wander. &nbsp;Yet the
descents are exhilarating. &nbsp;The combination of mental relaxation,
physical exertion, and pure adrenaline seems to stimulate poetic
aspirations. &nbsp;I keep a tiny voice recorder handy to capture the
spew.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The very first time I rode the trike, I located the world's best
Kevlar-belt-puncturing device (pictured beside the flat tire; note the
sharpened ends bent up vertically):<br>
