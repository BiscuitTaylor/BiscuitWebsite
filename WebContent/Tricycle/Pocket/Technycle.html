<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; I commute 9 miles to work.&nbsp;
I do it on the trike at least twice a week.&nbsp; Other times I
drive.&nbsp; I like the feeling of being oil-independent, though, when
I'm on the trike.&nbsp; My commute is rather hilly.<br>

Tradition of yellow<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"> &nbsp; I am visible yellow. &nbsp;I
have
a bright headlight (32 watts of halogen) and high-intensity LED
taillight, which both run off of the water-bottle style battery mounted
under the seat. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> &nbsp; The exercise that I get on the
Pocket is highly aerobic. &nbsp;With the low gear range of the Pocket
(thanks to small wheels coupled with standard drivetrain components), I
can take the big hills without my leg muscles going anaerobic.. </div>

<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; Riding this thing is a joy.&nbsp;
It seems effortless at times, yet, at the same time,
exhilerating.&nbsp;
It is odd to be so mentally relaxed and to feel an adrenaline rush at
the same time.&nbsp; I suspect that it is a feeling you can only get on
a trike.<br>

<div style="text-align: left;">Catrike Pocket - serial number 266.
&nbsp;(The serial number is on a sticker under the bottom of the
frame.)
&nbsp;Shipped from the factory in Florida around the second week of
November, '05. (Apparently the '06 Pockets are going to have adjustable
handlebars and a 20" back wheel, so let's call this a late '05
model.)&nbsp; It's got mostly SRAM and Full Speed Ahead (FSA)
components, with a few others in the mix.<br>

When I bought the trike at Peregrine Bicycle Works in Chico, CA, I had
several accessories installed by Hugh, the shop owner.<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">I have also added some more accessories
on my own.&nbsp; The most interesting addition is the Windwrap XT
fairing.<br>

Shopping for a trike<br>
&nbsp; I thought that I wanted a Short
Wheelbase (SWB) recumbent bicycle, with under-seat steering.&nbsp; I
researched, mostly reading the message board at<a
 href="http://www.bentrideronline.com/"> bentrideronline</a>.&nbsp; I
found that most recumbent bicycles now made have above-seat steering.
&nbsp;However, I noticed that tricycles used under-seat steering.
&nbsp;(Well, actually, the 'direct steering' of the Catrike is neither
above nor below the seat, but rather beside it... though there is a
tie-rod under the seat.)<br>
&nbsp; The first time I got on a recumbent was at a local shop:
&nbsp;they had a SWB bike with above-seat steering, and a tadpole
trike.
&nbsp;The SWB was okay, but the trike was just too much fun. &nbsp;I
knew I had to get one.<br>
&nbsp; I started researching which trike to buy. &nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.catrike.com/">Catrike</a> is popular, well-made,
light
weight, and relatively low cost.&nbsp; Catrikes are made in the USA, in
Florida. &nbsp;They are some of the lightest-weight trikes available
today. &nbsp;They are also some of the least costly.<br>
&nbsp; I found that there was a 'Gold'
level dealer in Chico, and got in touch with them (<a
 href="http://www.pbwbikes.com/">Peregrine Bicycle Works</a>).&nbsp;
PBW specializes in tricycles. &nbsp;The owner, Hugh Kern, has a lot of
experience with
tricycles, and knows all the tricks to get things working smoothly.<br>
