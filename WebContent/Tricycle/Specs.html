<div style="text-align: left;">Catrike Pocket - serial number 266.
&nbsp;(The serial number is on a sticker under the bottom of the
frame.)
&nbsp;Shipped from the factory in Florida around the second week of
November, '05.&nbsp; !18" (355) wheels all around.&nbsp; (Apparently
the '06 Pockets are going to have adjustable
handlebars and a 20" back wheel, so let's call this a late '05
model.)&nbsp; It's got mostly SRAM and Full Speed Ahead (FSA)
components, with a few others in the mix.<br>

<div style="text-align: left;">FSA Gossamer Isis triple <a
 href="http://www.fullspeedahead.com/fly.aspx?layout=product&amp;taxid=21&amp;pid=65">crankset</a>
with FSA 30/42/53 chainwheels. Shimano Ultegra front derailleur. (I
suspect that there's no SRAM front derailleur which is compatible with
the FSA triple cranks.) 9-speed 11-32 cassette (appears to be SRAM).
SRAM <a
 href="http://www.sram.com/en/sram/mountain/components/SX5/rear.php">SX-5</a>
rear derailleur. SRAM chain. SRAM Gripshift shifters.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A note about the drive train ... The SRAM mid-cage
derailleur supplied
with the 18"-wheeled Pocket doesn't really provide enough capacity to
take up all
the <a href="ChainSlack.jpg">slack</a>
in the small/small combination.&nbsp; I am thinking of disabling the
large
chainring (which I hardly
ever use), and shortening the chain.&nbsp; (I live in a very hilly
area,
so I don't have much use for large gears. &nbsp;It seems like I'm
always
either crawling up a hill, or screaming down one with the brakes
on.)&nbsp;
2006 Pockets will supposedly come with a 20" rear wheel and long-cage
derailleur.<br>
&nbsp; Nice <a

Marathon</a> tires, with reflective sidewalls. Sun M14A 6061 alloy
355x18.9 mm rims. Catrike front hubs, Shimano Deore FH-M510 rear hub. <a
 href="http://www.sram.com/en/avid/discbrakes/ballbearing5/ballbearing5.php">Avid</a>
Ball Bearing 5 disk brakes. &nbsp;The two brakes are identical, so one
(the left) is mounted above the axle, and the other is mounted below
the axle. &nbsp;There is not much room to work around the brakes, and
my Crank Bros. muti-tool won't fit in the space required to adjust the
spring tension on the left brake. &nbsp;Rather than removing the brake
to adjust it, I plan to buy a small 2.5 mm hex wrench that will fit
into the tight space.<br>
&nbsp; I expected bushings instead of headsets on the 'head tubes', but
they appear to be FSA headsets, possibly the FSA '<a
 href="http://www.fullspeedahead.com/fly.aspx?layout=product&amp;taxid=34&amp;pid=181">Orbit
Z</a>'. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; No manual , but I did get some documentation on the derailleurs
and crankset.<br>

When I bought the trike at Peregrine Bicycle Works in Chico, CA, I had
several accessories installed by Hugh, the shop owner.<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a
 href="http://www.oldmanmountain.com/rear_rack_page.htm">Old Man
Mountain</a> 'Sherpa' <span style="font-weight: bold;">rack</span>.&nbsp;
(<a href="UnderTheTable.jpg">Picture</a> of the rack installed on the
Pocket.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Radical <a
 href="http://www.radicaldesign.nl/en/products/recumbentbags/allfa_side_panniers.html">Allfa</a>
'Side <span style="font-weight: bold;">Panniers</span> US' - huge
capacity (2x28 liters), light weight. &nbsp;And a nice yellow color to
match the trike.&nbsp; <br>
These panniers don't fit perfectly, but I really like the way that they
fill in the space behind the seat. &nbsp;The frame/'seat stays' of the
Pocket get in the way a little bit, resulting in a slight loss of
volume
inside the pannier.&nbsp; I would estimate that I lose less than 1
liter
of volume on each side, due to this <a href="AlongTheCommute.jpg">deformation</a>.&nbsp;
So, the practical, usable volume with my installation is about 2x27
liters .)&nbsp; Still huge, and I like the design of the pannier,
having
only one big compartment that can handle bulky things easily.&nbsp;
Maybe not Arkel-quality construction, but well-made.&nbsp; I use <a
 href="http://www.eaglecreek.com/packing_solutions.html">Eagle Creek</a>
zippered bags to keep things organized.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; Two <a href="http://www.mirrycle.com/mountainmirrycle.htm">Mirrycle</a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> mirrors</span>, mounted on the handlebar
ends.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fenders</span>. &nbsp;I believe that
Hugh said that the fenders he installed were originally designed for a
Trice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cage</span> for a water
bottle.<br>
&nbsp; Water bottle <span style="font-weight: bold;">cage</span> for
my
Niterider battery, installed under the seat.<br>
&nbsp; Crank Brothers '<a
 href="http://www.cs.unca.edu/%7Eboyd/touring/eggbeater/eggbeater.html">Candy
C</a>' <span style="font-weight: bold;">pedals</span>, in yellow of
course. &nbsp;(I brought these with me and had Hugh install them.
&nbsp;The trike does not come equipped with pedals.)<br>
&nbsp; Mueller <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 href="http://www.mueller-hp.com/xt.htm">Windwrap XT</a> fairing</span>.
&nbsp;(This had not arrived when I picked up the trike, so Hugh shipped
it to me and Installed it (easily) myself. &nbsp;The only tricky part
was finding a new place to <a href="Fairing.html">mount the headlight</a>.
&nbsp;(Having it behind
the fairing produces too much glare on the fairing.) &nbsp;I added a
little yellow paint on the black frame of the fairing, just for fun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parking brake</span> -
Hugh put a band of old inner-tube on each handlebar, to be used to hold
the brake-levers tight. &nbsp;(There is no parking-brake built into the
Avid levers.)<br>
<br>
I have alwo added some more accessories on my own:<br>
NiteRider '<a
 href="http://www.niterider.com/accessories.php?type=taillights">Classic
Plus</a>' <span style="font-weight: bold;">headlight</span> system,
dual beam (20 and 12 watts) with water-bottle-style battery. &nbsp;When
I installed the fairing, I had to get a little creative with mounting
the headlight:&nbsp; a pair of '<span style="font-weight: bold;">bar-ends</span>'<a
 href="file:///E:/Biscuit/Tricycle/DisposableDigital/Eureka.jpg">linked
together</a> to form a headlight mount below the fairing.&nbsp; (There
is a nice photographic comparison of light output from different
headlights at http://eddys.com/page.cfm?PageID=493)<br>
NiteRider high-intensity LED <span style="font-weight: bold;">'</span><a
 href="http://www.niterider.com/accessories.php?type=taillights">Universal</a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">' taillight</span>, running off the main
NiteRider system battery, mounted to the top of the Sherpa rack.<br>
Old Cateye LED <span style="font-weight: bold;">taillight</span>,
mounted to the fender.<br>
A pair of Cateye <a
 href="http://www.cateye.com/en/products/viewProduct.php?modelId=18&amp;catId=7&amp;subCatId=2">EL-400</a>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">headlights</span>, mounted down low,
to the
inside of the front axles.<br>
An old Specialized bicycle <span style="font-weight: bold;">computer</span>.
&nbsp;The magnetic sensor and the computer itself are both mounted on
the right fender, with yellow :-) electrical tape holding the wire to
the fender.<br>
Eagle Creek <span style="font-weight: bold;">'</span><a
 href="http://www.eaglecreek.com/41022.html">Comfort</a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">' lumbar pillow</span>. &nbsp;The Pocket's
seat is slightly adjustable, but my back has a history, and I need more
lumbar support. &nbsp;The Eagle Creek can be inflated to just the right
fit. &nbsp;(I have one of these in each of my cars, also.)<br>
