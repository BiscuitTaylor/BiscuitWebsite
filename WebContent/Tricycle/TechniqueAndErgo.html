&nbsp; Learning to ride this trike, for me, was exciting, in part
because it was a little scary.&nbsp; I seemed to keep finding ways to
apply pressure to the bars unevenly, and the front wheels would wobble
back and forth rapidly.&nbsp; At higher speeds, I was concerned that I
might lose control.&nbsp; But, I never have.&nbsp; If I just ease up and
stop applying pressure, the trike corrects itself. &nbsp;I did some
experimenting with steering the handlebars, and made this discovery-
push on them: bad; pull on them: good.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">(I suspect that this may be more of an
issue for me than for most other Pocket riders.&nbsp; At 6' tall and
with fairly long arms, I might be close to being too big for the
Pocket.&nbsp; I think that the natural position of my arms tends to push
my hands into the bar grips.&nbsp; Maybe these handlebars don't really
fit me very well. &nbsp;Maybe I should try to get a set of the
adjustable '06 bars, if they become available).</span> &nbsp;If I try
pulling one bar and pushing the other, or applying pressure to the side,
I can run into problems. So, I try not to do that anymore!&nbsp; I
still have some surprises with the steering is while I'm turning the
grip-shift, but it's not too bad, I'm sure I'll improve with practice,
and at least I can choose when to shift. &nbsp;I also tend to produce
unwanted steering input when I shift my weight in the &nbsp;seat, or
generally move around without thinking about the handlebars. &nbsp;If I
steer by gently pulling back on the side I want to turn to, though,
everything is beautiful.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; Leaning into the turns is fun. &nbsp;Without leaning in, you
would risk raising the inside wheel off the ground, or possibly even
flipping the trike. &nbsp; It's fun to use the slight brake-steer to my
advantage on the windy downhills. &nbsp;(The trike pulls slightly in the
direction toward the side that you're braking on.) &nbsp;Several times
on Coyote Street, though, I have locked up one wheel with this
technique. &nbsp;I guess I just need to apply the brakes more evenly,
and rely less on the brake-steer.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><big>Ergonomics</big><br>
</div>
&nbsp; The gearing on the Pocket is low, which suits me just fine.
&nbsp;The low gear of 17 gear-inches allows me to easily get up hills
that were difficult on the mountain bike.<br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"> &nbsp; Leaning back in the seat seems to
be a key for me. &nbsp;This position takes weight off of my butt, and I
think I engage the glutes more in this position. &nbsp;It also moves my
arms back, so that , when relaxed, my hands naturally pull slightly on
the handlebars rather than push on them. &nbsp;(I think that my long
arms tend to push forward on the bars a little too much when I sit in a
more upright position.) &nbsp;Leaning back also gives me a little more
traction with the back wheel, and feels more balanced somehow.<br>
&nbsp; I need a lot of lumbar support, and the Catrike seat is not
adjustable enough for me, but it's fine with the addition of an Eagle
Creek inflatable lumbar pillow.<br>
