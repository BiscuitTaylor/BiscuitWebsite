      <small>For those of you who don't know Bun I will tell you some
things
about him. While I was in Nevada with my mom and Jerry our truck died on<br>
a road surrounded by desert and Jerry said that he found a rabbit that
you could walk right up to. So I went to go see if it was still there
and <br>
it was. You could stand about three feet away from it and it would just
sit there calmly eating. I tried to walk closer and it just hopped
slowly<br>
away. It would let Jerry get closer so he caught it for me and it
didn'teven squirm when I held it. So I took it to the truck and we were
able <br>
to get the truck to a motel where we stayed while we tried to fix the
truck. That night the bunny started sneezing up blood and we couldn't<br>
figure out why so we called the vet who told us that resperatory
problems are common in rabbits. He stopped sneezing and seemed<br>
fine until a week or so later he developed a big lump on his head. We
took him to the vet after I saw what looked like some sort of alein<br>
worm face in a hole in the lump. The vet pulled two huge maggots out of
his face one in the lump and one in a smaller lump beside his nose.<br>
The one by his nose was causing him to sneeze blood. We were told that
the maggots were most common in cattle and that eggs are layed by <br>
the flys in whatever animal and the eggs hatch and the maggots eat the
animal from the inside out. Now that he was healthy it was time to find
      <br>
a name for him. I went to web sites for baby names and web sites for
pet names but nothing seemed to fit him. So I took my nameless bunny<br>
werever I went and everyone started calling him bun bun or bunny and
I started to call him Bunbun and thus his name was born.<br>
Bunbun is now seven months old and comes when you call his name.<br>
