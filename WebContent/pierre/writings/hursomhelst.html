<p>Here I will drift into the very undisirable form of just telling you how it is, without any 
storytelling or something. This past week I came across the most amazing thing: a tuning fork! 
Yes, that makes it so I have been able to tune Cecilia's guitar so now it sounds good. Not perfect,
but good enough. So far I have remembered/learned again at least one chord of the guitar alfabet. 
</p><p>A week ago it was now that I went on an AFS camp in Stockholm. This time all of the exchange students 
were there. Thailand, a Russian girl, New Zealand, the United States, France, with others. 
There I was met by an interesting idea, that maybe I enjoy that kind of talkative, open atmosphere
 and people, more than I thought. When I first came, I thought of finding some peace and quiet here;
I thought I would be less talkative than the Swedish people, then I was surprised and thought
everyone talks a whole lot here. Then, now it seems different, people talk much sometimes, around 
their closer friends mostly, but at other times not much, like at a Russian dinner we had 
'hos Stephan' (at the Russian teacher's place). When I came to the camp last week in Stockholm,
 it was very enjoyable being in the company of talkative people, and though I did not talk so much,
I think it was a considerable amount for my not having met them but for one, two times. 
It was a very friendly atmosphere. Maybe it was just in that little microcosm, the AFS camp,
with the feeling of comradeship and being together in the same situation. </p><p>
Until what, a month ago or so, I was as I have been at home in los estados unidos. Talking 
more randomly and openly within my family, and being much more reserved and not-talking in
 society. It is hard to say what I am doing now, but I am being more active and extroverted.
</p><p>Dinner today was Älgkött with sås, plain boiled potatis, and sallad. That was all. It was really good,
 just really simple as well.</p><br>I learned how to write aquí, with that mark, last week,
and I am pleased by it. Ayer miré unos personas cuando escalaron una pared de hielo. Yesterday
 I watched some people when they climbed a wall of ice. It was the Swedish Masters competition.
 Still, not too overgrown with rules, it was more just 'climb'. I didn't climb, despite a possibility I could have had
 to if I had enrolled myself in the layman competition. Oh well. Fun to watch anyway. 
<br> For any Swedish translations, it is easiest to go to google.se and type in 'lexikon'.
