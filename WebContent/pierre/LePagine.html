Hey everyone! Thank you! For any support inspiration, encouragement,
reassuring, donating, or anything else you have given me.
<br>
That is what this site is, a way to say 'tack' and to somehow give back.<br>

in Winter</a><br>
Inspired by Rosa's cool page (check it out through my Dad's page!) I am
adding a little something for now...<br>
<a href="http://biscuit.nfshost.com/pierre/creamtop/pimpla.html">Ice
fishing</a><br>

If you are interested in the big lake animal (monster)<br>

If you don't know where &Ouml;stersund, or even Sweden, is,
go to the more introductory/informative start-site <a
 href="http://biscuit.nfshost.com/pierre/sweden.html">The site</a><br>
And now, some pictures that I took!<br>

Sometime, all this will find
a pattern and be organized.<br>

April 9, 6C windy snow maybe little rain also. Slush. <br>
<br>
April 2, halve meter snow and sunny, 0 c<br>
It was as deep a winter as I have ever experienced in a city, with
three four inches of snow and the road nothing but ice, but suddenly
there is
no snow, it is really warm (10-11 celcius, you don't need a hat or
gloves. Nice weather.)<br>
Weather update 25 November. 1 to -1 celcius, two inches of snow, roads
are ice. Cloudy. Sunrise at 8.45, sunset at 14.50
<br>
February! -5 to -10 celcius, sunny mostly, bright outside. Cold, but
the sun warms.</div>

The view of Fr&ouml;s&ouml;n, the island, from Arctura, the water
tower. Wham-o or some other exclamation. I still don't know how I
eventually got that image up. I didn't take it, by the way. <br>
<img src="arctura.jpg"><br style="text-align: center;">
And arctura itself, with the lights lit up. Pretty nice.<br>
<img src="radhus.jpg"><br style="text-align: center;">
The R&aring;dhus, council house, nextdoor to the school, the school is
on the left, in &Ouml;stersund. <br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
I am writing this from my own html, learned or helped remember from
what I have seen of it in Dad's page. And that means that everything
goes wrong. I just had a problem with that arctura thing because I was
missing a quotation mark.<br>
I am trying to keep all the pictures easily loadable and things like
that. If you have some questions or suggestions about anything on the
page or about my trip my
email is zippythesage@hotmail.com <br>
