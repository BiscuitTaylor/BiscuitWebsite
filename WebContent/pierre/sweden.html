Friends, supporters, and other people!:
<p>As you probably already know because you came to this
site, I am in a foreign exchange program to Sweden.<br>
I left on August 30 after much preparation
with the Swedish language, and now I will be staying here until the end
of June.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a lot harder with the language than I expected,
but I am doing well.<br>
I am even taking other foreign language courses here,and though that
sounds difficult,
it is actually very helpful because Spanish has many expressions which
are more like English
than Swedish; it helps in learning Swedish to work with it from two
angles. </p>
I have been
having fun here in Sweden, learning about the Swedish culture that lies
under the outside appearance. (Sweden is an industrialized country just
like the United States, and many things are apparently the same. That
means there are cars, supermarkets (both the same), computers,
the same movies mostly even though they are about two months late.)
Even though so much is the
same, it is also somehow really different.
<p>Take for example the food. Though it is generally the same, there
are differences in their eating habits. They seem to eat many more
'whole' foods,
and more wholesome meals throughout the day. We recieve a lunch at
school which could pass for a normal dinner in the U.S. And there are
many, kids mostly, people who drink milk with their
food.</p>
<p>Another thing is their cleanliness. It is quite clean; my
host-father, Sven-Martin
, cleans pretty much whenever there is something to be cleaned. We
often just lay our lunch or snack open sandwiches on the table; it is
just about as clean as the plates.</p>

Where is &Ouml;stersund?<br>
Or where is Sweden, even? <br>
Go to the Swedish version of the below site for a cool zoom-in.
&Ouml;stersund is on the right side of the big lake.<br>
Or, if you are just interested in the big lake animal (monster)<br>
