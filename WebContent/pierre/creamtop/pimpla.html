<h1 style="text-align: center;">Ice Fishing</h1>
 To 'pimpla' means to icefish.  <br> <img src="fisk1.JPG">
<br> Interestingly, I caught some fish (4). <img src="fisk3.JPG"><br>
It was really exciting, you could see the fish down there under you!<img src="fisk4.JPG"><br>
Even though it was -20C (0 F) and your feet froze. <img src="fisk5.JPG"><br>
Then, after the sun came up, all there was to do was to go home with some naturally deep-frozen fish for dinner!

<br> It's kind of late for this, that fishing was back in mid winter... but there it is. 
 <br> Sadly, not too sadly because at least I got to one time, this was my only time ice fishing...
