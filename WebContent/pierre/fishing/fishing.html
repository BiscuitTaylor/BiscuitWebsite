<h1 style="text-align: center;">Gone Fishing</h1>  
 It all began last winter, that time I was ice-fishing. Then I've been 
fishing many times at various places. <br> Here fishing while on a short 
canoe tour around Sikås, some small village in Jämtland. <img src="noret.JPG"> 
<br> That night, or the night before, we laid net on the lake, using this rowboat. 
<img src="rowing.JPG"> <br> The amazing thing was that we caught a fish on it, the first fish 
of the season, a huge Pike or whatever that is. (Gädda). <img src="nojdnetfiskare.JPG"> <br>
