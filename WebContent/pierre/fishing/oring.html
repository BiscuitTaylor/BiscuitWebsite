<h1 style="text-align: center;">Öringfiske (trout fishing)</h1>  
<br> It was a day of warmer waters, the fish were somehow more awake, and they took the 
bait, both on a normal fishing pole (no fish then with the fly fishing), both trout we caught 
at about the same time, both the same size. Strange. <br><img src="firstfish.JPG"><br>

  I went on to catch one more trout the next time, slightly larger and more bloody. I think
 the water was still to cold for Sven Martin's fly fishing.
